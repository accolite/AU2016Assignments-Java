Concerns Raised About<br/> Sustainability</p>

  <b>Bengaluru: </b> Getting environment clearance for any project, be it mining, quarrying or mega constructions, seems to be very easy in Karnataka. While project proponents say this is a positive trend, a recent analysis by Delhibased EIA Resource and Response
Centre (ERC), which keeps tabs on India's environmental,forest and wildlife clearance processes, says all's not well
in the way green nods are being given in Karnataka.The study, which has reviewed minutes of the meetings of project clearance proceedings by the
State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA),Karnataka, for the first quarter of 2015, found that on an average 97% of the projects get approved.Expressing shock over the fact that only 16 out of 565 projects from all sectors were rejected during the period under review, the study said: "The 16 projects were rejected because they were environmentally unsustainable.The moot question is whether the cleared projects are environmentally sustainable? The term environmentally unsustainable appears vague and isn’t defined in more detail."SEIAA Karnataka is a threemember body functioning since 2007 under the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF). It is tasked with giving environment clearances to projects (see box) based on recommendations of a state-level expert appraisal committee (SEAC) comprising subject experts. Largescale building constructions,stone quarries and sand mining are among major activities that are granted clearance."It clearly shows the urbanization trend as most of the buildings and constructions have been proposed in and around Bengaluru,"the report adds.According to the study, the environmental clearances are vague in their reasoning. "For example, one of the points state that the committee appraises the proposal after taking into account information provided in the statutory application form -1.
The committee, after discussion, decides to recommend the proposal for environmental clearance.This shows how vague EC approvals are. In one of its directives,the National Green Tribunal
has stated that appraisal requiresapplication of mind independently.Environment clearance authorities should scrutinize the projects closely. This is not reflected in SEIAA minutes of the meetings in Karnataka,"the study says.The analysis shows while there are cases of clearance for multiple extractions in stone quarrying,details pertaining to quantity of extraction are missing."The SEAC needs to do indepth appraisal of projects and go beyond the documents submitted by project proponents. The proceedings should reflect application of mind and expert reasoning
for recommending or declining a proposal," it said.The ERC study also points to lack of accessibility of information."Though, it is June 2016, minutes of meetings are available only up to March 2015," it said.

<h1 id="article6Heading">Three lost manholes of Church Street could be the reason behind its frequent flooding</h1>
<p class="article6author"><b>Aditi. Sequeira</b>@timesgroup.com</p>
<p class="article6content">
<b>Bengaluru:</b> Ever wondered why your favourite
Church Street gets flooded every
second day? The BWSSB should be able to
explain. The agency responsible for maintaining
Bengaluru's drainage system has
lost track of three manholes in the sewer
system right in the heart of the city. However,
the water board is quick to point fingers
at BBMP. According to it, the Palike
has relaid the road so many times in the
last two years that the manholes have been
buried and will probably never be traced.
The road that has witnessed many
rounds of digging and flooding over the
last few months, is every pedestrian’s
nightmare. The underground sewer network
on this stretch is believed to be part</p>

<img class="image6" src="images/article6image.jpg"/>

<p class="article6content">
of one of the earliest lines of the city's
planned drainage system. Urban conservationist
Harini Nagendra says she isn't
surprised about the way things are. "We
lack all sorts of data and misplacing old
maps of sewage pipes sounds quite possible,"
said Harini.
Said Tushar Girinath, chairman,
BWSSB, "We have lost at least three
chambers (manholes), because of which
it's difficult to address the problem of
leaking and overflowing manholes. We’ll
start cleaning the chambers that are visible
but it’ll be almost impossible to find
the ones we have lost track of. Frequent relaying of the road has resulted in the
same. For now, we are using our available
machinery to suck the muck out of the
chambers and hope to do so regularly."
However Satish N, additional chief
engineer, BWSSB, insisted that most of
the manholes are visible and it’s the restaurants that are messing up the system.
"Usually, the manholes overflow on
rainy days. Restaurants on Church
Street shouldn’t let rainwater into the
sewer system and should have a separate
line for the same. They must compulsorily
segregate waste."
"Repeated asphalting of roads can
bury chambers as high as 13 feet. However,
muck from the inspection chambers
can be removed in case of blockage. We
use jetting machines with rubber hose to
remove the muck."
Said Basvaraj Kambade, executive
engineer, BBMP: "The road is in a horrible
shape and the drains need to be replaced.
The sanitary lines are overflowing.
The existing sewer lines are full and
sewage from upstream areas too comes
to this road. Recently, the BWSSB had
dug up the road but am not sure if it has
served any purpose."
"We have called for tenders to carry
out upgradation work on this stretch.
It’ll take another two months to award
the final contract and four months to fix
the 600-metre-long road," he added.
