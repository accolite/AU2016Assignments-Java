Meeting Manager

Develop an application to manage sessions or meetings across various locations of Accolite

Expected to have 3 different set of user roles- admin,trainer and trainee

Admin Role 
create sessions with all details.
should able to assign to any trainer
send invite to list of trainer on any sessions created /trainer
ability to create feedback form for the session and share with all the trainee after the session is finished.Also should have the provision to see the response in pie chart
See training calendar/list of upcoming trainings

Trainer Role 
see the sessions assigned to and session details
send invite to list of trainee on any sessions assigned to him/her
ability to send notification or reminder to all trainees before the session starts, with his own description.
should able to create poll during session and see trainee response in pie chart.

Trainee
   should able to see all session invite and accept or reject.
   should able to see all reminder or notifications
   ability to participate in poll
   ability to participate in feedback

Good to have:
Upload files, ppt, code snippets by trainer.
Ability to Download by trainee.
Share code snippets in sessions.




























SOLUTION 
[ First Iteration - Prototype Model - Scrum/Agile ]

Welcome the user with a login screen. Servlet Validates and redirects to appropriate page
[ Recycle logic from Tomcat Assignment and Servlet Assignment ] 
Register Page
[ All JavaScript validation logic recycled from RegEx stuff ]

FULL STACK : 
FRONT END
CSS Libraries - BootStrap
JS Libraries -Chart.js, [ Somehow integrate D3.js ]
( To be added libraries for code beautifcation-snippet management, handling file uploads etc in next iteration )
HTML5, jQuery( Ajax )

BACK END
Discussion must as 2 members have expertise in PHP.
For now I am assuming Java but would like to switch to Angular or PHP.
Server - Tomcat

Assumptions :
All notifications via email !






































Admin Role 
create sessions with all details.
->
Session details will be stored in a table :
SESSION - 
( int SessionID [Primary Key, Auto Inc.] , nvarchar(50) Session Name, (sql.date) Date , (sql.date) Start Time, (sql.date) End Time )
TRAINERS - 
( int  SessionID,  int TrainerID,varchar(50) TrainerName, nvarchar(50) TrainerEmail )
Primary Key - SessionID + TrainerID
TRAINEE - ( int SessionID, int TraineeID, nvarchar(50) TraineeEmail, Date LoginTime, Date LogoutTime, int accepted )
Primary Key - SessionID + TraineeID.
Bring all tables to 3NF

User Table :
Role Description : 


should able to assign to any trainer.
-> 
SQL Query - If trainer already exists for session, default behaviour is to add a co-trainer(s)
No Duplicates.

send invite to list of trainee on any sessions created
-> Recycle javax.mail module.
Checkbox on every session creation - If a checkbox is checked by Admin -
Dyanmically generate Subject, Message Body and send an email from Admin account to all trainees ( Joining SESSION and TRAINEE to get TraineeEmail )

ability to create feedback form for the session and share with all the trainee after the session is finished.Also should have the provision to see the response in pie chart
See training calendar/list of upcoming trainings Also, we deliver this in 2nd Sprint
-> I have ideas but better to ask Mathan what is the best way to do it.
My way involves static DS, listeners etc and Chart.js on front end but there has to be a better way.























Trainer Role 

see the sessions assigned to and session details
-> Button accessible to Trainer on login to sessions.
Basically SQL Query to fetch all sessions where TrainerID = x and display other details in say a Bootstrap Modal !

send invite to list of trainee on any sessions assigned to him/her
-> Recycle admin email module COMPLETELY with higher permission control.

ability to send notification or reminder to all trainees before the session starts, with his own description.
-> Build on top of previous - only difference is Take Subject and Content.
Three ways to go about this : 
1. Assume that trainer sends notification to trainees on button press asynchronously. (EASY)
2. Take a time from Trainer to send that reminder ->
2a) Schedule using Listener and static undelivered Email Object ( Time, SessionID, TrainerID, Subject, Content ) 
2a) Schedule using hourly timed AJAX call and a class which handles Email Object

should able to create poll during session and see trainee response in pie chart.
-> THIS WILL BE TRICKY ( 2nd Iteration ) - Let’s ask Mathan but here’s how I would do it-
WAY 1 :
( Only 1 poll can be active at a time during a session )
setPoll( Poll Question, Options ) - From Trainer page.
[ Servlet /poll initialised with static DataStructure ]
/poll?username=”Username” - By Trainees, they get an option to vote and response is recorded in static hashmap.
/poll?trainer - Visualize the response using Chart.js 
OR DRILLDOWN FOR MAX IMPACT (http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5944371)

WAY 2 :
Learn Google Docs and Outsource this work using APIs













Trainee

   should able to see all session invite and accept or reject.
->
The email received by the trainee shall contain two URLs.
localhost:8080/acceptSession?status=true or status=false&sessionId=XYZ
acceptSessionServlet runs a query to update corresponding trainee’s interest in a session in the DB by setting accepted in Trainee to 0 or 1.

should able to see all reminder or notifications
-> Email

   ability to participate in poll
   ability to participate in feedback
To be decided - Same as before

Good to have:
Upload files, ppt, code snippets by trainer.
Ability to Download by trainee.
Share code snippets in sessions.

[ File upload possible in Servlets. One out of us 4 does POC-other does Flow/Integration into the bigger picture. We do this in second iteration.]
