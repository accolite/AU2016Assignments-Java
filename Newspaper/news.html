		The laws of cricket are maintained by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). There are various formats 
		ranging from Twenty20, played over a few hours with each team having a single innings of 20 overs, to Test cricket, played over five days 
		with unlimited overs and the teams playing two innings apiece.<br/><br/><strong>Pranav champs</strong><br/> Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit but in limited overs cricket 
		they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball which
		is a hard, solid object made of compressed leather enclosing a cork core.Although cricket's origins are uncertain, it is first recorded 
		in south-east England in the 16th century.<br/><br/><strong>Big win for Rana</strong><br/> It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, leading to the first international 
		matches in the mid-19th century. ICC, the game's governing body, has over 100 members, ten of which are full members who play Test cricket.

		Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. Cricket is the world's second most
		popular spectator sport, after association football, and is followed primarily in Australasia, Great Britain and Ireland,
		the Indian subcontinent, southern Africa and the West Indies.
