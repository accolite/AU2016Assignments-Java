																									<p>BENGALURU: Bengaluru is witnessing an alarming rise in cybercrimes, with senior citizens being the primary victims. The number of cybercrime cases reported to the state's Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has increased to 135 in the first seven months of the year, compared to 47 in the whole of 2015. And the money lost this year is already Rs 7.75 crore, a 230% increase from the Rs 2.35 crore last year.
Older people are the favoured targets of these scamsters. A septuagenarian who came to police recently said he lost a whopping Rs 74 lakh after responding to an SMS he received in 2013 that claimed he had won five million pounds in an online lottery. The fraudsters kept demanding money on the plea that it was required to release the full amount of the winnings.</p>
