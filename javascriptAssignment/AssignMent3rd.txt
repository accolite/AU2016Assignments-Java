
var list = readHugeList();

var nextListItem = function() {
	var item = list.pop();
		if (item) {
		// process the list item...
		setTimeOut(nextListItem,0);
	}
};

The reason why this works is because of the phenomenon of Event Table and Event Queue i.e. when the setTimeOut function is called it places the function 
on which it was called in an event table and when the specified event happens the function is simply moved to event queue The JavaScript engine 
constantly checks whether the call stack is empty, and whenever it’s empty, it checks if the event queue has any functions waiting to be invoked.
If it does, then the first function in the queue gets invoked and moved over into the call stack. If the event queue is empty, then
 this monitoring process just keeps on running indefinitely and that results in an infinite event Loop.
