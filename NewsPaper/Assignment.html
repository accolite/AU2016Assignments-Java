locked together at the top of
the leaderboard on 11-underpar
after six holes of the British
Open third round on Saturday.
Royal Troon was showing
its teeth for the second day
running, with the winds
whipping up to 20mph on the
west coast of Scotland and
making good scoring tough.
American Mickelson, 46, who
has led the championship
since day one, made an early
birdie at the third but that
was matched by his Swedish
playing partner who also
birdied the first.
Stenson then nosed in
front of the five-times major
winner when he picked up another
stroke at the fourth.
However, a bogey at the sixth
for the world number six
meant he dropped back to 11-
under alongside Mickelson.Stenson then nosed in

In third place on eight-under
was Dane Soren Kjeldsen,
after seven holes, two ahead of
American trio JB Holmes
(13), Bill Haas (nine) and Keegan
Bradley (seven). Haas
produced one of the shots of
the day at Troon's signature
eighth, splashing out from a
greenside bunker at the Postage
Stamp and watching his
ball dive into the cup.

early starters and suggested
the critics were being "unfair"
to him, urging everyone
to be less negative about his
performances after returning
a one-over 72. The young
American enjoyed a remarkable
season last year, landing
the US Masters and US Open
crowns as he surged to the top
of the rankings.Anirban Lahiri was disillusioned
after stumbling to a disappointing
five-over-par 76 in
the third round.The reigning
Asian Tour number one struggled
on the greens, needing 32
putts which included three
putting on three occasions as
he fell off the pace.
A double bogey on the second
hole set the tone for Lahiri's
difficult day. A birdie on
four was the Indian's only respite
as he dropped three
straight bogeys from the 10th
hole before missing a short
par attempt at the last. <img src="7.jpg" align="left" height="270" width="160">
