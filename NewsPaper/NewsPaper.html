							<p style="margin:0px">Chandigarh:In complete contrast
to the first day, on which the spectator
turnout was around a meagre
50, nearly 600 people turned out to
give India’s doubles pair of Leander
Paes and Rohan Bopanna a rapturous
welcome as they took on
South Korean duo Hong Chung and
Yunseong Chung at the Chandigarh
Club on Saturday. Everyone
was interested in seeing what kind
of camaraderie — if any — would
be on display between the controversial
pairing of Paes and Bopanna
as they played their only game
before the Rio Olympics next
month. As it turned out, they did extremely
well, winning the match in
straight sets 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 in just an
hour and 41minutes to seal a world

Leander rightly said in the postmatch
press meet that they had
“two-three gears left” and could
have upped the ante.
<p style="padding-bottom:0px;">It was a clinical performance
from the experienced pair. Once
when Paes was broken in the third
set, the joy on the face of Hong and
Chung said it all — the Korean
pair themselves couldn’t believe
they managed to do it. Paes and
Bopanna strode on to the court
with a customary high-five and
then breezed through the first set.
Incredibly, Bopanna lost just a solitary
point throughout the set on
his serve. The break came in the
eighth game, when Paes hit a volleyed
winner to give India two
break points. Bopanna then complemented
Paes well to ram home
a winner and seal the break.
A similar script panned out in
the second set. Hong’s serve was
broken in the third game once
again, Paes made a winning return</p>

						to get India the break, and Bopanna
served out the set in his typical
roaring fashion. The third set was
somewhat competitive. The Indian
pair broke Chung in the very first
game of the third set. It seemed that
Paes and Bopanna would breeze
through but Chung and Hong broke
Paes in the sixth game to bring the
set on an even keel. The Indian pair,
though, was in no mood to let the
match go into the fourth set and
broke the Koreans in the next game.
After the match, Paes was full of
praise for the two singles players —
Ramkumar Ramanathan and Saketh
Myneni — who had given India
a 2-0 lead on Friday in adverse
weather conditions.

<p style="padding-top:0px;">
Chandigarh:AITA is insisting that
Rohan Bopanna and Sania Mirza
should be allowed to travel with
their respective trainers to the Rio
Olympic Games but the Indian
Olympic Association has not yet
agreed to the tennis body's
demand. However, IOA has a policy
of allowing only 50 per cent of the
team strength as support staff and
AITA has already named two other
members as support staff. All India
Tennis Association's predicament is
that they want Zeeshan Ali, who has
been appointed as captain cum
coach of the side and Sania Mirza's
mother Nasima Mirza, who is the
women's team manager, to also
travel with the players. "Yes, IOA
has not agreed to allow
four-member staff for the tennis

that Sania wants her trainer Robert
Ballard to be with her during the
Games while Bopanna's preference
is Yash Pandey. AGENCIES

<h3 >Indian doubles duo
‘settles’ differences</h3>	
<p>
Chandigarh: The Leander
Paes-Rohan Bopanna jugalbandi
on Saturday against
the South Koreans allayed
fears that personal differences
would go against a
good performance. The Indians
lost just 17 points on
their serve in the entire
game. Quite incredibly, in
the first set, Bopanna lost only
one point on his serve
while Paes lost two points on
his serve in the second set.
Paes and Bopanna weren’t
exactly up against
tough rivals and, as Paes
pointed out, the duo had lots
left in the tank. “Even if the
competition was tough, we
could have raised the level of
our game. We had several
more gears to go,” said Paes.
The Olympics, however,
will pose a different and far
more serious challenge, as
Paes knows well. Bopanna,
on his part, hailed the pair’s
on-court chemistry. “The oncourt
chemistry between us
was great. If it wasn’t good,
we could not have got such a
convincing win. We did not
push much and just made
sure that we come out strong
in the end. Gradually, it (oncourt
chemistry) will become

we could not have got such a
convincing win. We did not
push much and just made
sure that we come out strong

chemistry) will become
even better,” he said.
“We won in three sets.
Both of us were playing well.
It has been a great season for
us. We are on top of our game.
We have played together really
well in the past and even
now the understanding between
us looks quite good,”
Paes reflected. Bopanna had
earlier stated clearly stated
that he and Paes didn’t make
agood doubles team.

the visitors ended their first innings

with impressive figures of
3/16 while bowling on the opening

of eight boundaries.</p><p style="padding:0px;">

They were earlier shot out for

Kohli to the

skipper reached his fifty
in no time, but just
as he was looking to
get some more time
under his belt, he was
trapped LBW by Rahkeem
Cornwall (5/118). Rahane
then added 44 runs with Stuart
Binny (16), before the latter
was caught behind off the
same bowler. In fact, the burly
Cornwall, who top-scored for
the home team on the opening
day with 41 runs, troubled the
entire Indian middle order
with his off-break bowling.

He had bowled Cheteshwar
Pujara (28) in the final
over of day one, and after scalping
both Kohli and Binny, he
then dismissed Rahane as
well. Rahane was looking
well set until then, playing some
choice strokes, but a sharp
turner ballooned to leg slip as
he prodded forward.

Wriddhiman Saha (31
from 47) batted fluently for a
bit as well, before Jadeja failed
to respond to his call for a
second run, and he was runout.
As such, India lost four
wickets in the second session.

Ajinkya Rahane and Wriddhiman

thirties. But the worrisome bit
was that home side off-break bowler
Rahkeem Cornwall picked up

line-up's frailty against spin.
“I think we will be at an advantage
if the pitches are spin-friendly.
We have three quality spinners
off the five-wicket haul by Cornwall.
“I don't know about other venues.
Out here, the pitch has been
a little slow. The ball goes soft after
20-30 overs and as a bowler or
fielding team, everybody has to
put a lot of effort. If there is not
much assistance from the wicket,
then coping with the weather is
going is a challenge. Everyone needs
to make an effort together, but
we are up for it,” he added. PTI
who are in good form in the Test
format, so we will be very happy if
we get turning wickets,” he said.
“At the same time, we have firepower
in pace department as
well. All of them have increased
their fitness levels and pace, so it
is good to see them bending their
back on tough wickets like these.
They are getting the ball to carry,

		<h3>Variety is the key
to Shah’s success</h3>
	        <div class="f21">

			London: Pakistan's
Yasir
Shah, who took
six wickets
in England’s
first innings,
said varying
his pace had been behind his
spectacular return to Test
cricket at Lord's on Friday. It
was the first time a leg-spinner
had taken five wickets in a Test
innings at the 'home of cricket'
since Shah's fellow Pakistani
Mushtaq Ahmed performed
the feat 20 years ago. What made
Shah's feat impressive was
that this was his first Test outside
of Asia and the UAE.
It was also his first Test since
completing a three-month
drugs ban after he tested positive
for the masking agent chlortalidone.
With Ahmed, now a
member of Pakistan's coaching
staff acting as an interpreter,
Shah said: "I've played
lots of cricket in the UAE where
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="f22">
			<p>where
you have to bowl quicker. In
England you have to concentrate
on varying your pace. My
role was very clear, to give support
to the fast bowlers, but
luckily I got the five wickets
and I'm glad for the team." As
for Shah getting his name on
the honours board, Ahmed,
who took 5-57 in Pakistan's 164-
run win over England at Lord's
in 1996, added: "It's a honour for
Yasir to take five wickets at the
home of cricket. When you
turn up all the bowlers and
batsmen go to see other Pakistani
names on the honours board.
When you see your name
on there you feel so proud. AFP</p>

	<h2>BCCI unhappy with Taufel</h2>
	        <div class="f31">
			<p>New Delhi: Simon Taufel’s
role as mentor to Indian umpires
has come under the
scanner with the Indian
cricket board (BCCI) expressing
dissatisfaction with the
Australian’s commitment to
the job. TOI has learnt that
BCCI may not renew the former
international umpire’s
contract after September.
A year after he retired in
2012, Taufel was roped in by
BCCI at a hefty fee to educate
domestic-level umpires.
Taufel is currently paid
around $50,000 for a year but
many within the board feel
he “hasn’t done justice” to
the high salary. “The board
wants to cut out unnecessary
expenditure. Much was
expected of Taufel but his
work over the past couple of
years hasn’t been satisfactory.
The board is willing to
look at someone else,” a top
BCCI official told TOI, adding:
“He spent very little
time in India. If you add up</p>
			</div>
			<div class="f32">
			<img src="http://epaperbeta.timesofindia.com/NasData/Publications/TheTimesOfIndia/Bangalore/2016/07/17/Photographs/019/17_07_2016_019_049_003.jpg">
			<p>
			the days he spends before the
Ranji Trophy and the IPL, he
interacts with Indian umpires
at the most for a fortnight
a year. It is not worth
paying him so much.”
When Taufel took over, India
had not a representative
in the ICC’s elite panel for
many years, in fact since the
retirement of S Venkataraghavan.
S Ravi managed to
break in last year, with C
Shamshuddin and Anil
Chaudhary finding their
places in the list of on-field
umpires in the ICC’s international
panel. “He was initially	
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="f33">
			<p>
		given a two-year contract. But
his performance was reviewed
last year and it was decided
he should be given only
one-year contracts. There’s
no denying that there has
been a healthy change since
he took over but our umpires
too have evolved a lot,” noted
another BCCI official. “If
there is a change in International
Cricket Council’s regulation
or something like that,
the board can always hire the
services of a professional.”
Indian umpiring courted
controversy with Vineet Kulkarni
being dropped from the
ICC’s international panel after
the World Twenty20 this
year. TOI had reported on
February 24 that the BCCI
was planning to withdraw his
name from the ICC panel following
complaints from
Team India and domestic
teams and allegations he was
fast-tracked into the panel.
Taufel, who was named
ICC’s umpire of the year in
2004 and 2008, also resigned
from his post of ICC’s umpire
performance and training
manager last October
