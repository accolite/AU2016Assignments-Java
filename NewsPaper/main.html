		<p>In 1992, soon after finishing school at St Columba’s in Delhi, Dhruv Shringi started a firm that was into chemical manufacturing. But that did not quite take off, and Shringi shut it down two years later and decided to focus on chartered accountancy. He did his CA and while doing so, worked at accounting firm Arthur Andersen. In 2000, he quit Arthur Andersen to do an MBA and then went on to join Ford, and then, about two years later, ebookers in the US. ebookers was an online flight booking service and Shringi was director of group operations and technology. He lost the job in 2005 when ebookers was acquired by New York-based business and consumer services provider Cendant. But that spurred him to get back to his first love </p>

There is a bit of that, but not a lot. The
problem with VCs is that they are finance
guys, not entrepreneurs. They know to how
raise money. Kleiner Perkins is very successful
in the US because they don’t have
finance guys but only entrepreneurs as
VCs. The finance VCs will be there as well.feed the winners, starve the losers. They
do so because they can’t help the entrepreneur.

		industry growth in India. What gives you
confidence for future?
The journey shows that we did lot of things
right. And if we don’t do anything wrong,
there is no reason why we will not be number
one. We could do better and we are
comparing ourselves to the US, which
shows how we benchmark ourselves. We
need a modern successful economic model
at scale. People who have studied in India
are heading world’s largest technology
companies — shows what we can do. We
lost confidence because of colonisation.
Today’s generation is cocky. I prefer that.
<p class="bold2">Are SaaS companies going to bring about
the real revolution rather than consumer
product companies?</p>
Nobody can give you the answer. We will
build companies that will leverage our circumstances.
We always do more for less.
Our products can hit mass market because for instance, in
fashion e-commerce, in India people can
hire hundreds of tailors and do alterations
easily which is not possible in the West.
Technology is not an option. It is a necessary
tool. Technology will change shows what we can do. We
lost confidence because of colonisation.
Today’s generation is cocky.
