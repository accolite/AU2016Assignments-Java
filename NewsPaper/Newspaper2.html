                  If you are amongst the thousands who visited Kashmir this summer before last week's strife soured things and left a taste of tragedy and heartache all around, you may have had a chance to sample some new beginnings. For the last two years, and particularly in the last few months, restaurant start-ups in Srinagar have been sweetening things up in the Valley's summer capital, marking its gradual return to normal life and the little pleasures such a life can afford. From a French style bakery to a pretty English style tea room, from a chic co-working space to a coffee cube serving up piri piri chicken by the Jhelum, restaurant retail formats by young food entrepreneurs have been gaining the attention of both locals and tourists alike. Most of these cafés, bakeries and restaurants are pretty aligned to the latest in food fashion in the Indian metros and other dining capitals of the world. Now, with the fresh bout of violence, their young owners are uncertain, and hoping that the past will not come back to haunt them.
               </p>
               <p>
                  “For the last 30-40 years, things had just not changed,“ says Hayat Bhat, who looks after the legendary Adhoo's that his family has owned and run since 1918, and hopes to give it a new direction. “It was only when young Kashmiris who had either studied abroad or lived in cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru started returning and setting up their own cafés and restaurants 
                  started 
                  <image src="im2.jpg" width=100% alt="image2">
                  changing. This boom is much needed.People want newer experiences. Younger people here are abreast with trends thanks to TV and internet,“ he points out.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Adhoo's, with a reputation for the best Kashmiri wazwan, has been under renovation; Bhat's planning a makeover that will see contemporarised offerings while keeping the essence of the old. He plans an open-air grill section in the courtyard that was coveted before militancy took over, a new café on the site of the old bakery, to serve up pizzas and platters besides the old specials like walnut tarts and peach pies. And he plans to lighten some of the wazwan specials. “We will contemporarise a few things. Like gushtaba could be presented differently for a younger audience...“ he trails off.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The plans though are now on tenterhooks. The renovation, already delayed by a year, is set to finish next year. But Bhat hopes “the situation doesn't become what it was in 2010, when we were all forced to stay shut for six months....“

                  Le Delice, a French-style bakery on Boulevard Road, has legions of offline and online admirers, all with a good word about its fresh baguettes, croissants, macarons, éclairs, and more. Saqib Mir, 34, who runs it with

                           Mir, who belongs to Srinagar and talks about Kashmir's indigenous baking tradition, enrolled for a diploma in French bakery in Paris and worked with a few chefs there, before returning home. “I travelled throughout India and found that though there were German bakeries in tourist hotspots, there were hardly any French-style ones even in the metros,“ he points out. In September 2014, Mir was ready to roll out his bakery and café when the floods hit. He lost all his equipment and furniture and some investment in the process. “ After that I didn't know whether I wanted to take a risk again,“ he says.But he did, though on a smaller scale.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Le Delice is a bakery-only model with around 30 products on its menu. However, its instant success has encouraged Mir to set up another store in another part of the town, “for people who come from far -flung areas to buy our breads.“ Now, he is unsure. “We chose to come back though it is tough to do things here...“ he says.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           In India, it is hardly easy to set up restaurants anywhere -policy and licensing grey areas, high rents and a crunch of trained manpower are just some key difficulties any newbie restaurateur deals with. In a strife economy like Kashmir's things are obviously tougher, with entrepreneurs pointing out the corruption and lack of government support.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           “It's a hassle sourcing basic things like freezers and cooking equipment from outside. Rents and overheads are lower but finding the right staff is a big challenge. People who have lived in strife for 25-30 years can't have the right attitude for service. They don't have exposure or training and to get them to do something differently is a big issue,“ says Roohi Nazki, who has recently opened Chai Jaai. Chai Jaai, a tea room with a Victorian air and interiors done up with local Kashmiri tiles and papier mache craft, serves both Kashmiri teas like Kahwa and the salty Noon Chai as well as global brews. It has been open for just about a month. Nazki, a former Tata's employee based in Mumbai, came back to Kashmir, where she had spent her school years when her father was posted as director, Doordarshan. She met Jagdish Mehta (who passed away just earlier this month) of the iconic Mahatta & Co, the photo studio, on the Bund.

                           Mehta showed her pictures of the 1940s, when there used to be a tea room alongside the studio. It was he who partnered with her to open this new one which has been getting a good response.With the recent violence, it is shut for now .“But life moves on. Each time,

                           When Mubeen Masudi gave up a lucrative job in a US based company in Gur gaon to return to Srina gar, his parents were worried. “Not because of the conflict -we're all used to it -but because they felt it wasn't wise to give up a job to chase a dream,“ says the IIT-Bombay alumnus.Masudi wanted to set up a coaching centre to help bright children from economically backward sections in Kashmir get into top educational institutes. Four years after he set up Rise Institute of Scientific Education in 2012, four of his students got into IIT this year. “One girl made it to St Stephen's, Delhi,“ he says.

                           Getting a business up and running in Jammu and Kashmir involves more than the usual challenges of raising funding, finding talent, and getting strategy , branding and marketing right

                        <p>
                           Despite these challenges, a number of young people are returning to Kashmir to set up ventures, get their compatriots to work again, and do their bit for the local economy . The businesses they're getting into range from education and software to putting Kashmir's age-old handicrafts online.

                           Some like 25-year-old Furkan Khan have ventured into non-profits. “Things do not move at the pace you envisage, and at times it can bog you down,“ says Khan, founder of Karvaan, an initiative to create libraries in village schools. “Important meetings are cancelled because of sudden curfews,“ says the social entrepreneur, who quit her job as a communications coordinator in the UK and returned to Srinagar in May . This week, for instance, mobile ser vices were suspended and last weekend, it was the internet. “Internet blockades break communication with our stu dents,“ says Masudi. So they've had to innovate and build an app. “Even if there is a shutdown for a couple of days, lessons and assignments continue. That's how we managed during the 2014 floods when we lost over 3,000 books,“ he says. And de spite the violence this week, he doesn't regret his decision to return. “Our aim is -as we'd been taught at IIT -to strive to create an impact,“ he says.

                  Impact is what 24-year-old Ahmer Khan -founder of event management startup Loudbeetle -has been striving for too, and managed to achieve when he organized Asia's largest iftar party last year. “We hosted a 1.6km-long chain over `dastarkhans', with over 3,500 Kashmiris participating,“ says Khan, who also men tors aspiring entrepreneurs in Kashmir.

                  Industrialist Shakeel Qalandar says there is a lot of potential waiting to be tapped in the Valley . Qalandar was part of a central government panel headed by former RBI governor C Rangarajan in 2010 to formulate policies for job op portunities in Kashmir. “Young people can start ventures in both the manufac turing and service sectors. It's great to hear about the startup scene here,“ he says. More could have been done for young people if the panel's recommen dations had been adopted, he added.

               <p>
                  These included setting up a skill devel opment scheme under a public-private partnership model, and reviving flow of credit to certain sectors.

                  Easier access to funding is some thing Danish Mir would have appreci ated after the 2014 floods. “We suffered huge losses and had to move to Mumbai for a while,“ says Mir, who co-founded the Kashmir-specific shopping site, Kashmirbasket.com in 2013 after a stint at Wipro. Mir, who is from a middle class family, came up with the idea when he was in college in Pune.

				  Every time the 27-year-old was going home for the holidays, his friends would send long lists of things they wanted from Kashmir -dry fruits, shawls, silk scarves, saf fron and wazwan. “I know how people admire the art, culture and handicrafts from my state and are will

He too lost every penny in the 2014 floods. “My friends left and went back to Delhi but I decided to stick around,“ says ul Haq, who is from an agricultural family , and de cided to start a food processing plant in Lassipora in Pulwama district. “My par ents were completely against it. So were my in-laws-to-be since I had just got en gaged at the time,“ says the 31-year-old.

                           Muslims found the local Sunni imams naïve because they had no answer to their doubts about Islam. So they turned to the Salafi preachers who sounded more appealing. This is how Salafism gained ground in Padne,“ says Abdurehman.

                           But of late, the influence of ultraSalafism was becoming evident in the youth of the area. “As an adolescent, Hafeesudheen had all the problems typical of a kid born in an affluent Dubai-based family. He was sent back to Kerala to be `reformed'. But the changes that occurred in him in the past few years were unimaginable. He professed hatred for everything he once loved in his childhood, like movies and desert safaris,“ says Abdul Salam, Hafeesudheen's uncle.

                           Exactly fifty years ago someone made a TV serial that was set in the 23rd century , in deep space, “where no man has gone before“.It got yanked off the air after only three seasons, because of poor viewership ratings. And thus it should have disappeared into media oblivion forever.Except that, after it was yanked off, its popularity suddenly exploded, and led to numerous re-runs, follow-up serials, movies, comics, games, merchandise and a huge, die-hard cult following. And that TV serial was, of course, Star Trek.

                           Star Trek has been ranked as the No 1 cult TV serial of all time, as well as one of the Top 15 movie franchises (in the same ballpark as Star Wars, Harry Potter and James Bond). But more important, perhaps, is the social impact it has had over the years: the subculture it created has an almost religious zeal, to the extent that the UK government once investigated it as a messianic cult which, in pursuit of its idealistic vision, might trigger an anarchic rebellion.

Thus Star Trek was an early champion of issues like feminism, the struggle against racism, the war in Vietnam and the Cold War, and in the process Roddenberry often clashed violently with studio executives, who feared that his radical social messages would upset viewers and cause ratings to plummet.

Some of the wildly futuristic technology concepts Star Trek presented back in the 1960s have now become an everyday reality -partly because they inspired a generation of young engineers to invent them, and partly because Rodenberry and his team based their concepts on actual cutting-edge scientific research.

But seeing the sudden blockbuster success of sci-fi movies like Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind and George Lucas's Star Wars, they decided to make it into a movie instead. That was Star Trek: The Motion Picture, released in 1979. Since then there have been 11 sequel (and prequel) films, not to mention five fresh TV series.The latest in the series is Star Trek: Beyond, which is scheduled to release shortly, to mark the

For the first Star Trek movie, in 1979, she was selected out of hundreds of candidates to play the part of Lieutenant Aliea, the gorgeous alien navigator of USS Enterprise -a part she made memorable with her iconically beautiful bald head. The late Ms Khambatta might not be on board Star Trek: Beyond, but there are two Indian-origin actors, Deep Roy and Harpreet Sandhu, who play the roles of Keenser and a cockpit crew-member respectively , thereby going -to twist the famous Star Trek catch-phrase -where only one Indian has gone before.
