Initially the call stack in javascript is empty.

If we call a function nextListItem() , then we add a new frame to the top of the stack.

when nextListItem finishes execution , it calls itself, then it'll add a new frame onto the stack.

Since recursive function will keep adding frames until either they finish processing, or they exceed
the max length of the call stack, resulting in an overflow.
-----------------
Because setTimeout() is an asynchronous operation, it doesn't block the function, which means
nextListItem will be allowed to finish and its frame can be popped off the call stack- preventing it
from growing. The recursive call will be handled with the event loop insted.
------------------
var list = readHugeList();
var nextListItem = function() {
var item = list.pop();
if (item) {
// process the list item...
//Here add setTimeout(nextListItem,for any time);
nextListItem();
}
};
